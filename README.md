# Final_iOS_Bootcamp_Project-EndBulling-Nada
A social app to solve teenagers bullying


## Motivation
Nowadays we have a serious problem in schools, out of school or even in Internet related to bullying and arassement to teenagers which in some cases it may lead, God forbid, to suicide.

Out of 10 teenagers bullied, only one tells their parents or someone they trust. Therefore we need some mechanisms to revert theses figures making it easier for them to talk without shame or fear under competent and confident people.


## Project description
A non-profit, humanitarian, social, interactive application that takes care of adolescents who are being bullied inside or outside the school or on websites.

It gives the aolecents an opportunity to present their problem without clarifying their real name or personal information.

After reviewing it, psychiatrists or consultants in this field communicate with him/her and develop appropriate solutions to solve his/her problem for free.

After completion, if the person wishes, he can present his/her experience to be a realistic and be motivational to others that are also suffering arasement.

The application contains a part in which stories and videos of people who were previously subjected to bullying and did not give up, and thanks to that, they survived it and were able to continue their lives naturally, away from bullying. 

This application mainly serves the Ministry of Education due to the large number of bullying that occurs in schools.


## Target Users
Teenagers: Who are subjected to bullying and cannot talk about it either because of shyness or fear.

Voluntier psychotherapist: Who aims through his work to build a society with good mental health.
